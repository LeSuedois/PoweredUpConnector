This git includes a Eagle/Fusion360 library and a STL for a female Lego Powered UP connector.
Since this undocumented Connector uses 1.27mm pitch the easiest is to buy a 6 pin pinheader with the approriate pitch.
I use Multicomp Pro MC-HVT1-06-G pinheader (Farnell code 2852588). 
A slighly longer pinheader like Samtec TMS-106-53-G-S should be better but is not avaliable in small quantity.

Many thanks to "Philo" (www.philohome.com) for all the documentation he did over the years!
